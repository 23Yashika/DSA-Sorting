#  DSA Sorting Algorithms in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of the three fundamental sorting algorithms used in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**

Each algorithm is implemented in a clean and beginner-friendly way using basic Java concepts like arrays and loops.

#✅ Sorting Algorithms Covered
1. Bubble Sort
Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they’re in the wrong order.

Repeats until the array is sorted.

Time Complexity: O(n²)

Best Case (Already Sorted): O(n)

2. Insertion Sort
Builds the sorted array one element at a time.

Places each new element in its correct position among the already-sorted elements.

Time Complexity: O(n²)

Best Case (Nearly Sorted): O(n)

3. Selection Sort
Finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning.

Repeats for the remaining unsorted part.

Time Complexity: O(n²)
